My end goal is to find a place that enables me to learn and grow for a sincere purpose.  In the past, I've made use of data and technology to accomplish several of these.  
* identifying and rewarding talent at a large school district
* aiding oncology practioners in solving any number of issues at a multi-state medical organization
* contributing to the design and evaluation of clinical trials in radiation oncology

Of late, I have worked to widen my knowledge of <a href="https://snyderjo.github.io/iris_api/">API's</a> (both use of and creation), firm up my knowledge of <a href="https://snyderjo.github.io/Neural-Network-Tutorial/">neural networks</a>, and their potential applications in <a href="https://snyderjo.github.io/MelanomaIdentification/">medicine<a>.

I am, also, developing an interest in the recruiting space---largely because no one has found a signal which can consistently identify (potential) talent.
