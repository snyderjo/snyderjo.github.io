        <p style="padding" float="left">My name is John Snyder.  I am a Senior Statistical Data Analyst with the <a href="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/about/transforming-healthcare/innovation/clinical-programs/oncology/">Oncology Clinical Progam</a> of <a href="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/">Intermoutain Healthcare</a>.  I engage with physicians, administrators, and executives to improve the quality of healthcare delivery.  My duties extend to developing key process indicators, predictive analytics, and research.</p>

        <p>I completed a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics from <a href="https://www.grinnell.edu/">Grinnell College</a>, and a Master of Science in statististics from <a href="https://www.osu.edu/">Ohio State University</a>.  Between the two, I taugh English as a second language in China and Germany, the latter awarded through the <a href="https://www.fulbright.de/">Fulbright</a>.</p>

        <p>I spent five years at the <a href="https://www.wcer.wisc.edu/">Wisconsin Center for Education Research</a> as a Quantitative Data Analyst.  In this role, I produced quantitative measures of educator and institutional effectiveness in improving student achievement, which administrators used for employee evaluation in a Union-Management environment.</p>

        <p>I have utilized <a href="https://R-Project.org/">R</a> extensively, employing it in data cleaning, report development, visualization, and predictive analytics.  I have also exhaustively used SAS and SQL, and have a familiarity with python.</p>

        <p>My interests include statistics and machine learning.  Most recently, I have worked to expand my knowledge of <a href="https://github.com/snyderjo/Neural-Network-Tutorial/blob/master/nnfiles/MNIST%20test.ipynb" target="_blank" >neural networks</a>.  I've had success making use of publicly available data to create convolutional neural networks that <a href="documents/Kaggle_Melanoma_CNN.html">can help identify for malignant skin lesions</a>.  Eventually, I hope to  apply natural language processing to expidite referals of newly-diagnosed cancer patients to appropriate practitioners.</p>
