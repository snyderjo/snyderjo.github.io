    <p style="padding" float="left">My name is John Snyder.  I am a Senior Statistical Data Analyst with the <a href="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/about/transforming-healthcare/innovation/clinical-programs/oncology/">Oncology Clinical Progam</a> of <a href="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/">Intermoutain Healthcare</a>, where I interact with physicians, administrators, and practitioners to improve the quality of healthcare delivery.</p>

    <p>I completed a B.A. in mathematics from <a href="https://www.grinnell.edu/">Grinnell College</a>, and a Master of Science in Statististics from <a href="https://www.osu.edu/">Ohio State University</a>.  Between the two, I taugh English as a second language in China and Germany, the latter awarded through the <a href="https://www.fulbright.de/">Fulbright</a>.</p>

    <p>I spent five years at the <a href="https://www.wcer.wisc.edu/">Wisconsin Center for Education Research</a> as a Quantitative Data Analyst, producing quantitative evaltuations of educators and educational institutions.</p>

    <p>My interests include statistics and machine learning.  Most recently, I have worked to expand my knowledge of neural networks, with the hope of applying natural language processing to expidite referals of new patients to appropriate practitioners.</p>
