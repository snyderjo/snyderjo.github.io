title: "Fully Connected Neural Networks presentation"
---

I presented on the topic of [fully-connected neural networks](https://www.meetup.com/slcpython/events/ptpwwsyfccbgb/) at the [SLC Python](https://www.meetup.com/slcpython/) meetup!

I presented the information in this [github repo](https://github.com/snyderjo/intro_to_nn_presentation).

Video forthcoming!

Thanks for organizing, Faris!

Thanks for hosting, U of U!
