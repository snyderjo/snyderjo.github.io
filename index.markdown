For more than I decade, I have used data, analytics, and technology to improve systems and processes.  I have:
- designed experiements and statistically evaluated resulting data to improve cancer care;  
- helped a multi-state healthcare organizations reduce costs, identify treatment gaps, and improve outcomes; and
- consulted with large school district to quantitatively identify and reward internal talent. 

In that time, I have developed practical knowledge of data systems, machine learning, and artificial intelligence and used it to collaborate with a diverse array of subject matter experts.

Current role: Data Scientist
